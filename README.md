## NewðŸš€ Unlocking Insights with Power BI ðŸš€
Iâ€™ve just built an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides deep insights into sales, delivery performance, and customer behaviours. With multiple visuals, itâ€™s designed to help decision-makers understand key metrics at a glance.

ðŸ”¹ Key Metrics & Cards:

â€¢	Sum of Sales: Total sales revenue.
â€¢	Average Delivery Time: How quickly products are being delivered on average.
â€¢	Quantity Sold: Total quantity sold over a specified period.
â€¢	Returns: Understanding return trends and volumes.

ðŸ”¹ Visualizations:
â€¢	Clustered Bar Chart: Breakdown of Profits by Product & Sales by Customer.
â€¢	Pie Chart: Sales by Segment to understand where the majority of our sales are coming from.
â€¢	Donut Chart: Sales by Market to identify the most profitable markets.
â€¢	Global Map: Sales by Country to view international sales performance.

ðŸ”¹ Key DAX Formula Used: For Delivery Time calculation:
DAX
Delivery Time = DATEDIFF(Orders[Order Date], Orders[Ship Date], DAY)  
This provides the number of days between the order date and the ship date, allowing us to monitor delivery efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Model View: To ensure accurate data, Iâ€™ve connected the Order ID from both the Orders and Returns tables. This connection ensures that the Returns card updates in real time with the return data.
